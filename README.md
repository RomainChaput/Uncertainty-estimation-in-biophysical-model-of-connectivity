# Codes for Uncertainty propagation into numerical biophysical model of fish larval connectivity in the Florida Keys

This repository contains the post-processing codes necessary for the uncertainty analysis performed in Chaput R., Sochala P., Miron P., Kourafalou V.H., Iskandarani M., 2022. Uncertainty propagation into numerical biophysical model of fish larval connectivity in the Florida Keys. Submitted to ICES Journal of Marine Science.

In this study, we investigate the impacts of seven uncertain biological parameters on simulated larval connectivity in the Florida Keys using polynomial chaos surrogate. These parameters describe biological traits and behaviors --such as mortality, swimming abilities and orientation-- and modulate larval settlement as well as dispersal forecasts. However, these parameters are poorly constrained by observations and vary naturally between individual larvae. In the study, we characterize the input uncertainties with probability density functions informed by previous studies of Abudefduf saxatilis. The parametric domain is sampled via ensemble calculations, then a polynomial-based surrogate is built to explicitly approximate the dependence of the model outputs on the uncertain model inputs which enables a robust statistical analysis of uncertainties. This approach allows the computation of probabilistic dispersal kernels that are further analyzed to understand the impact of the parameter uncertainties. 

We share here the codes that allow to replicate the method presented in the publication: compilation of the samples, computation of the polynomial chaos coefficients, construction of the model surrogate, and estimation of the dispersal kernels.

The biophysical model and specific orientation module used to obtain the samples are available at https://github.com/RomainChaput/connectivity-modeling-system
